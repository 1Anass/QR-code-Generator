# QR-code-Generator

In this project, I built a platform where restaurants can upload their menu and generate a corresponding QR code. The QR code can be put on the restaurant tables, and whenever a client scans it, the restaurant menu shows up on his phone. 

The application backend is developed using Java and Spring boot, and the frontend is developed using ReactJs.
